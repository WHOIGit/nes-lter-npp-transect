This dataset consists of primary production measurements conducted during 24-h deckboard incubations using uptake of 13C-bicarbonate. Sampling occurred on NES-LTER Transect cruises during summer, fall, and winter, starting in summer 2019. Stable isotope enrichment and associated POC determinations were done at the Univ. Maryland Central Appalachian Laboratory Stable Isotope Facility. There are two data tables included, compiling all cruises: 1. calculation of depth-specific primary productivity (based on fractional light levels of the surface irradiance with reference to the PAR profile), and 2. calculation of the integrated primary productivity. The tables derive from a provided Excel spreadsheet with R script referenced.

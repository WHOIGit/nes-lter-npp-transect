CTD Rosette Sampling on NES-LTER Transect Cruises

Sampling occurred in the framework of the Northeast US Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) site seasonally during cruises on both the R/V Endeavor (summer, winter) and R/V Armstrong (fall) at the NES-LTER site. The number of stations sampled ranged from 5 to 7 per cruise. Hydrographic data were collected with a SBE911 CTD (Seabird Electronics, Inc.) equipped with sensors for chlorophyll fluorescence (WET Labs ECO-AFL/FL) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; Biospherical Instruments QSP2000). Water was collected at various depths with a rosette sampler (Seabird SBE32 Carousel Water Sampler). For NPP incubations, water was collected from 3-4 depths depending on the depth at the station. During collection, water was pre-filtered through 200 µm mesh into acid-washed 2 L polycarbonate bottles. 

Incubation

Bottles were spiked with a solution of 99% 13C-labeled sodium bicarbonate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for a final 10% enrichment of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and placed in various mesh bags to simulate in situ light levels. Bottles were incubated for approximately 24 hours in deckboard incubators with flow-through seawater, and Onset HOBO data loggers recorded tank water temperature. At each station, the natural abundance of 13C in the water was determined from an un-spiked sample. On 1-2 cruises per year, a spiked dark sample was collected at each station to correct for dark carbon assimilation. The corresponding light levels at collection depths were predetermined from the PAR profile during daytime CTD casts. Using daytime cast information, a relationship was established between beam attenuation (At; measured by a transmissometer) and the light extinction coefficient (K_d) for each cast. During nighttime casts, K_d was estimated from the average At in the upper 10 m using the slope and intercept from equation 1: K_d = m * At + b
 
Sample Collection

At the end of each incubation, bottles were filtered under low vacuum (5-10 in. Hg) over pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (450˚C; 6 h). Size fractionation was accomplished by pre-filtering samples through 47 mm-diameter polycarbonate filters with either 5 µm or 20 µm pore size, resulting in NPP rates from phytoplankton in the <5 µm and <20 µm size classes. Additionally, surface samples included a 10 µm pre-filter to obtain NPP rates from the <10 µm size class, aligning filter sizes with those used to determine microzooplankton grazing rates (Menden-Deuer lab) on phytoplankton. Triplicates were collected for surface samples for the >0 µm size fraction and <10 µm size fraction. Filters were stored at -20˚C until further analysis on shore. 

Sample Analysis

NPP rates were quantified by measuring the incorporation of isotopically heavy carbon into phytoplankton biomass. Prior to measuring 13C in the samples, filters were acid fumigated with concentrated hydrochloric acid in a desiccator overnight to remove inorganic carbon. They were dried in an oven at 60˚C for 24 h, individually wrapped in tin capsules and analyzed on a Carlo Erba NC2500 elemental analyzer interfaced with a Thermo Delta V+ isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) at the Univ. of Maryland Central Appalachian Laboratory Stable Isotope Facility.

Calculations: Discrete Estimates

NPP rates were calculated from delta13C values using equations of Hama et al., 1983. Particulate organic carbon (POC) measurements were blank corrected such that combusted filter blanks were analyzed in triplicate and the mean value was subtracted from each POC sample obtained from the EA-IRMS. Raw time-zero POC data for each station are located in the data package other entity raw_npp_data.csv, in the rows where alternate_sample_id is “NatAbun”. Calculations were completed in R. 

Calculations: Integrated Estimates

Discrete NPP rates were integrated by depth for each station via trapezoidal integration, with calculations completed in R. 

Quality Assurance

We checked differences between replicates and provided a column in the data table to indicate quality using IODE Primary Level flags 1 good; 3 questionable/suspect. Any sample with a negative NPP value is provided with a flag of 3. We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. Quality assurance and data package assembly were completed in R, with documentation available at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-npp-transect.
